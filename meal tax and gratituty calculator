print("Hello my name is AI, I am a meal tax and gratuity calculator!")
print(" ")

#User Input
user_name  = input("What is your name?")
meal = float(input("How much was the total price of your meal, " +  user_name + "?" ))
print(" ")

#Formula 1
fake_total_cost = meal + (meal * sales_tax) + (meal * gratuity)

#Final User Input
deduction = float(input("Do you have any price deductions {Do not put a neagtive sign}, " +  user_name + "?" ))

#Formula 2
total_costz = fake_total_cost - deduction

#Finished AI Output
