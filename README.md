This is a repository of projects that I have created over the course of time. I have been developing these programs from quite some time and a friend of mine suggested that I should let the world see my work. So here it is, feel free to contact me or anyone from my school organization to get in touch about developing projects. 

If you find my work to be interguing please feel free to contact me about anything.
