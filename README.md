Credits
1) Most of the code provided here is of my own
2) The code titled with "zzz"... has some code that has been created by someone else. So make sure to give them credit. 

Welcome to my Python 3 repository, these are some files that I have created over the course of time. Feel free to contact me to discuss projects I am working on or more. My preferred IDE is PyCharm or PyScripter for python.
