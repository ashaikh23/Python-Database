Python
This is a repository of projects that I have created over the course of time. I have been developing these programs from quite some time and a friend of mine suggested that I should let the world see my work. So here it is, feel free to contact me or anyone from my school organization to get in touch about developing projects. 

If you find my work to be interguing please feel free to contact me about anything.
I use a wide arrangement of IDLE's to set up my code such as PyCharm.

Credits
1) Most of the code provided here is of my own
2) The code titled with "zzz"... has some code that has been created by someone else. So make sure to give them credit.
